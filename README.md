## develop  
### developing with vue   
For development, we will need to have a distributed version control system set up. See this [short intro](https://storage.googleapis.com/arminakhavan-dot-co/introgit/intro_to_git.html#6) for general information on git.


After Forking to your account, __Clone__ the repository to your local machine by:      

``` git clone <your-github-repository>```


Point into the project folder in terminal:     


it is a good idea to use the `vue-cli` which is the vuejs' client for creating and working with the vue development components from command line.    
install with `npm`:
```
npm install -g @vue/cli
```


```cd remembrance```


Install the project dependencies with npm.   


```
npm install
```   
Run the node server with:    

```
npm start serve
```
